How can XR transform the current
state of mowing?

Manual mowing with a riding lawn mower traditionally
offers little to no digital assistance. However, in the era
of Mixed Reality, Smart Data, and real-time simulations,
the opportunity arises to completely redefine the
mowing experience.


Can an intelligent, adaptive immersive XR cockpit
support the driver by enhancing the efficiency and
precision of mowing operations—while simultaneously
combining enjoyment, safety, and control?


- Cockpit/telemetry (visible/recorded while mowing):

- Speed, mowing efficiency, remaining & elapsed mowing time,
total operating hours, battery level (e-tractors) or fuel level
(gas), tilt angle (safety).

- Mowing history, maintenance reminders (e.g., blades/oil), and
service logs/manual/video guides in the app.
Smart lawn tractors (solo® by AL-KO) functions:

- Detail dashboards:

- Time, Bluetooth connection, battery voltage, mower deck/lights on/off, max remaining mowing time (battery-/fuel-
based), Eco mode, cruise control, efficiency/blockage hints.

- Connection via Bluetooth to the inTOUCH app.
